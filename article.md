# TwistEmbed: Non-Commutative Geometry for Word Embeddings

## Abstract

In this paper, we introduce TwistEmbed, a novel approach to generating word embeddings by leveraging non-commutative geometry. Traditional word embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, utilize Euclidean geometry and symmetric relationships, which may not capture the full complexity of linguistic structures. We propose a new method based on non-commutative geometry, which allows us to explore higher-order relationships and better model the intricacies of natural language. We discuss the limitations of existing symmetric solutions, the significance of our approach, and alternate methods for addressing the problem.

## 1. Introduction

Word embeddings are a fundamental component of many natural language processing tasks, representing words as high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic and syntactic information. Most existing word embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, rely on Euclidean geometry and symmetric relationships between words to derive these vector representations. While these methods have shown significant success, they may not be sufficient for capturing the full complexity of linguistic structures, especially when considering higher-order relationships and non-commutative interactions.

In this paper, we propose TwistEmbed, a new approach to generating word embeddings based on non-commutative geometry. We explore the use of non-commutative algebras, Hilbert spaces, and Dirac operators to create a new framework for modeling word embeddings that accounts for the intricate relationships found in natural language.

## 2. Limitations of Existing Symmetric Solutions

Traditional word embedding techniques are based on symmetric relationships, which assume that the similarity between two words is equal in both directions (i.e., similarity(word1, word2) = similarity(word2, word1)). This assumption is limiting because it may not adequately capture the inherent asymmetry found in natural language, where the context and order of words play a crucial role in determining meaning.

Furthermore, most existing techniques are based on Euclidean geometry, which assumes that the relationships between words can be modeled using simple distances and angles in a vector space. While this assumption has proven effective for many NLP tasks, it may not be sufficient for capturing more complex, higher-order relationships between words.

## 3. TwistEmbed: A Non-Commutative Geometry-Based Approach

To address these limitations, we propose TwistEmbed, a novel approach that leverages non-commutative geometry to model word embeddings. In TwistEmbed, we construct a non-commutative algebra based on word embeddings and their relationships to capture the inherent asymmetry in natural language. We then define a Hilbert space representation for the word embeddings and a Dirac operator that captures the geometric information of the embeddings in the Hilbert space.

By using non-commutative geometry, TwistEmbed can potentially capture more complex interactions between words and better model the intricacies of natural language. Additionally, the new distance metric derived from the non-commutative geometry, such as the Connes' metric, allows us to optimize our embeddings based on the underlying geometric structure of the space.

## 4. Significance of TwistEmbed

The significance of TwistEmbed lies in its ability to model more complex, higher-order relationships between words, enabling better representations of linguistic structures. By leveraging non-commutative geometry, TwistEmbed can potentially improve the quality of word embeddings for various NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Furthermore, the framework provided by TwistEmbed opens up new avenues of research for exploring the geometric and algebraic properties of word embeddings and their application to natural language processing.

## 5. Alternate Approaches

There are other approaches to address the limitations of existing symmetric solutions, such as topological data analysis and cohomology theory. These methods aim to study the topological structure of the word embeddings vector space and capture higher-order relationships between words. While these approaches have shown promise in various applications, they require a deep understanding of topological or cohomological concepts and may be computationally expensive for large datasets.

## 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced TwistEmbed, a novel approach to generating word embeddings based on non-commutative geometry. By leveraging non-commutative algebras, Hilbert spaces, and Dirac operators, TwistEmbed can potentially capture more complex relationships between words and better model the intricacies of natural language. We discussed the limitations of existing symmetric solutions, the significance of our approach, and alternate methods for addressing the problem. TwistEmbed opens up new avenues of research for studying the geometric and algebraic properties of word embeddings and their application to natural language processing.
